#' Calculate the expected values from a bet

#' A fair bet is the one which leads to a expected value equal to cero.
#' Someone who is unwilling to make a fair bet is risk averse. A person
#' who is indifferent about making a fair bet is risk neutral. A person who
#' is risk preferring will make a fair bet. (Perloff J. M., 2020)
